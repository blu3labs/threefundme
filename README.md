# ThreeFundMe


# Description

Introducing ThreeFundMeâ€”an innovative on-chain application designed for seamless campaign creation, contribution, and communication. The platform boasts a user-friendly interface where you can explore and engage with various campaigns. Each campaign features a structured set of steps, comprising titles, descriptions, and fundraising goals. These steps detail the owner's objectives for utilizing the raised funds. Notably, the owner can only access the funds once a step's goal is met and the allotted time expires, prompting progression to the next phase. To keep contributors informed, owners can create multiple posts per step, providing a comprehensive timeline of their progress.


# How it's made

ThreeFundMe is the culmination of meticulous development, blending React for its dynamic frontend and Solidity to power the backend contracts. Our contract ecosystem comprises three integral components: the CompaignFactoryManager, housing comprehensive campaign data; the CompaignFactory, facilitating the creation of new campaigns; and the Compaign contract, the core logic governing each campaign's functionality.

Throughout our project journey, collaboration has been key. We've partnered with WalletConnect, ENS, and NounsDao to fortify our frontend UI and authentication capabilities. Leveraging Waku, we've integrated a robust chat system enabling seamless communication among contributors within each campaign. Moreover, the contribution will be made by using the utility token ApeCoin. To ensure efficient data management, we've harnessed the power of TheGraph, constructing an indexer for our CompaignFactoryManager on Ethereum's Sepolia. 

Our chain-related partnerships have been instrumental. Scroll, Metamask (Linea), and Base have played pivotal roles in our deployment strategy. Deploying our contracts across Scroll Testnet, Linea Goerli Testnet, Base Goerli, and Sepolia Ethereum, we've strived for comprehensive testing and seamless integration across various blockchain environments.


# Solidity contracts



# Main architecture

Three contracts will manage all the logic of the platform ThreeFundMe.


## CompaignFactoryManager.sol


The factory manager will manage as a global storage of all the compaigns created by the users.

## CompaignFactory.sol

The factory will create a new compaign and will store it in the factory manager.


## Compaign.sol

The compaign will manage all the logic of the compaign, the compaign will be created by the factory and will be stored in the factory manager.
